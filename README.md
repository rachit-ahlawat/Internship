# Internship
In **Task 1** of  I have cleaned and pre-processed 'Medical Appointment No Shows' dataset from kaggle. The dataset and jupiter notebook is attached in the repository.
 I am a MBA Business Analytics student so I have basicknowledge about python. I mostly reffered my class notes for this task. Below is sequence of actions performed by me.
- Loading datase
- Checking for null values (no null value found)
- Checking duplicate rows (no duplicate row found)
- Renaming column names
- Renamimg Gender 'f' to female and 'm' to male
- Converting all the strings to lower_case
- Converting date to datetime format
- Checking datatypes of all columns
- At last i checked value count of diffrent age where I found two people with **age 0 and -1**, which is not appropriate, so I removed those rows from the dataset.
